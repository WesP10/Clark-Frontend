# Clark-Frontend
This repository, maintained by Weston Clark, houses the code for his personal website. Here, youâ€™ll find a blend of creativity, functionality, and expression. Dive into the codebase to discover Clark's journey

## Purpose
This repo contains my earliest attempts to learn html5, css, and javascript. The home page has links to many great projects I made for Advanced Intro to App Development. Including a gallery and interactive chart of cats, re-usable dropdown buttons, tic-tac-toe, mock website for a client, a fairly fleshed out version of js pong, Brawl Stars stat tracking app (connected to custom node.js server), and more.
